It seems to me that the essential task of **producing** a Fest (in this case) revolves and *resolves* around making decisions, i.e. reducing the set of all possible options to a few, dictated by (mostly economic, sponsoring) circumstance and manpower (students willing to put some time to making this happen). Currently the topics are:

```
Food
	- Semmel sponsoring
	  Y: find (KHG Mensa?) topings
	  N: alternative like Samosas 
	  Hurry for Curry quote: 4€/Samosa with dips
Drinks
	- Commission-based approach
	  Y: find a good deal
	  N: start to stockpile and get direct drinks sponsors as part of this
	  Red Bull: flat rate package sponsorship an option?
```
